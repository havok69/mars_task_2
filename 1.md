## Problem 1

The primary mechanism that ROS nodes use to communicate is to send messages. Messages in ROS are organized into named topics. The idea is that a node that wants to share information will publish messages on the appropriate topic or topics; a node that wants to receive information will subscribe to the topic or topics that itâ€™s interested in. The ROS master takes care of ensuring that publishers and subscribers can find each other; the messages themselves are sent directly from publisher to subscriber.
